🚀 Accelerate the development of your news application backend with **ht_api**, the
dedicated API service for the Headlines Toolkit. Built on the high-performance
Dart Frog framework, `ht_api` provides the essential server-side infrastructure
specifically designed to power robust and feature-rich news applications.

`ht_api` is a core component of the **Headlines Toolkit**, a comprehensive,
source-available ecosystem designed for building feature-rich news
applications, which also includes a Flutter [mobile app](https://github.com/headlines-toolkit/ht-main) and a web-based [content
management dashboard](https://github.com/headlines-toolkit/ht-dashboard).

## ✨ Key Capabilities

*   🔒 **Flexible & Secure Authentication:** Provide seamless user access with
    a unified system supporting passwordless sign-in, anonymous guest
    accounts, and a secure, context-aware login flow for privileged dashboard
    users (e.g., 'admin', 'publisher').

*   ⚡️ **Flexible Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular
    permissions with a flexible, multi-role system. Assign multiple roles to
    users (e.g., 'admin', 'publisher', 'premium_user') to precisely control
    access to different API features and data management capabilities.

*   ⚙️ **Synchronized App Settings:** Ensure a consistent and personalized user
    experience across devices by effortlessly syncing application preferences
    like theme, language, font styles, and more.

*   👤 **Personalized User Preferences:** Enable richer user interactions by
    managing and syncing user-specific data such as saved headlines, followed sources, or other personalized content tailored to individual users.

*   💾 **Robust Data Management:** Securely manage core news data (headlines,
    categories, sources) through a well-structured API that supports flexible
    querying and sorting for dynamic content presentation.

*   📊 **Dynamic Dashboard Summary:** Access real-time, aggregated metrics on
    key data points like total headlines, categories, and sources, providing
    an at-a-glance overview for administrative dashboards.

*   🔧 **Solid Technical Foundation:** Built with Dart and the high-performance
    Dart Frog framework, offering a maintainable codebase, standardized API
    responses, and built-in access control for developers.

## 💻 Setup & Running

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Dart SDK (`>=3.0.0`)
    *   PostgreSQL (`>=14.0` recommended)
    *   Dart Frog CLI (`dart pub global activate dart_frog_cli`)

2.  **Configuration:**
    Before running the server, you must configure the database connection by
    setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project or export the variable in
    your shell:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/ht_api_db"
    ```

3.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/headlines-toolkit/ht-api.git
    cd ht-api
    ```
4.  **Get dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dart pub get
    ```
5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    dart_frog dev
    ```
    The API will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080`. On the
    first startup, the server will connect to your PostgreSQL database, create the
    necessary tables, and seed them with initial fixture data. This process is
    non-destructive; it uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `INSERT ... ON
    CONFLICT DO NOTHING` to avoid overwriting existing tables or data.


    **Note on Web Client Integration (CORS):**
    To allow web applications (like the HT Dashboard) to connect to this API,
    the `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` environment variable must be set to the
    specific origin of your web application (e.g., `https://your-dashboard.com`).
    For local development, if this variable is not set, the API defaults to
    allowing `http://localhost:3000` and issues a console warning. See the
    `routes/api/v1/_middleware.dart` file for the exact implementation details.

## ✅ Testing

Ensure the API is robust and meets quality standards by running the test suite:

```bash
# Ensure very_good_cli is activated: dart pub global activate very_good_cli
very_good test --min-coverage 90
```

Aim for a minimum of 90% line coverage.
