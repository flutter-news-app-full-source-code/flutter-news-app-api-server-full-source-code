/// High-Level Plan for Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
/// in the Headlines Toolkit API (ht-api).
///
/// This plan outlines the key tasks required to transition from the basic
/// ModelOwnership approach to a more flexible RBAC system, tailored to the
/// project's existing architecture and shared packages.
///
/// This is a high-level overview and does not include implementation details.

// Assuming the User model in ht_shared has been updated to include a 'role' property.

// 1. Define Roles and Permissions (Initially within ht_api)
//    - Determine the specific roles needed (e.g., admin, standard_user, editor).
//    - Define granular permissions for each resource and action (e.g., 'headline.read',
//      'category.create', 'user_settings.update', 'favorite_list.add').
//    - Store these permission strings as static constants within the ht_api package
//      (e.g., in a new file like lib/src/permissions.dart).
//    - Map which permissions are assigned to which roles (e.g., using a Map or class
//      within ht_api).

// 2. Create Authorization Service (Within ht_api)
//    - Implement a dedicated service (e.g., AuthorizationService in lib/src/services/)
//      that encapsulates the logic for checking permissions.
//    - This service will take an authenticated User object and a requested permission
//      string, and determine if the user's role(s) grant them that permission based
//      on the hardcoded role-permission mapping.

// 3. Integrate Authorization Checks into Middleware/Routes
//    - Modify the /api/v1/data/_middleware.dart to check permissions based on
//      the requested model and HTTP method using the new AuthorizationService.
//      (e.g., check for 'modelName.read' for GET, 'modelName.create' for POST).
//    - For user-owned resources (like settings or future favorite lists), update
//      middleware (e.g., routes/api/v1/users/[userId]/settings/_middleware.dart)
//      or handlers to combine the permission check (e.g., 'user_settings.update')
//      with the ownership check (authenticated user ID matches resource owner ID,
//      unless user is admin).

// 4. Refine Ownership Checks (Within ht_api middleware/handlers or Repositories)
//    - For user-owned resources, ensure repository methods accept the authenticated
//      userId and enforce that operations are limited to resources owned by that user
//      (unless the user is an admin). This pattern is already partially used and
//      can be consistently applied.

// 5. Refactor Existing Access Control
//    - Replace existing basic isAdmin checks and simple ownership comparisons
//      in route handlers with calls to the new AuthorizationService and/or rely
//      on the updated middleware/repository checks.

// 6. Add Tests
//    - Write unit and integration tests for the new AuthorizationService, middleware,
//      and affected route handlers to ensure permissions and ownership are enforced correctly.
