# This is an example environment file.
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual configuration values.
# The .env file is ignored by Git and should NOT be committed.

# REQUIRED: The full connection string for your MongoDB instance.
# The application cannot start without a database connection.
# DATABASE_URL="mongodb://user:password@localhost:27017/flutter_news_app_api_server_full_source_code_db"

# REQUIRED: A secure, randomly generated secret for signing JWTs.
# The application cannot start without this.
# Generate a secure key using: dart pub global run dcli_scripts create_key
# JWT_SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-and-long-jwt-key"

# OPTIONAL: The duration for which a JWT is valid, in hours.
# Defaults to 1 hour if not specified.
# JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS="1"

# REQUIRED FOR PRODUCTION: The specific origin URL of your web client.
# This allows the client (e.g., the HT Dashboard) to make requests to the API.
# For local development, this can be left unset as 'localhost' is allowed by default.
# CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN="https://your-dashboard.com"

# REQUIRED: Your SendGrid API key for sending emails.

# ADMIN OVERRIDE: Sets the single administrator account for the application.
# On server startup, the system ensures that the user with this email is the
# one and only administrator.
# - If no admin exists, one will be created with this email.
# - If an admin with a DIFFERENT email exists, they will be REMOVED and
#   replaced by a new admin with this email.
# - If an admin with this email already exists, nothing changes.
# This provides a secure way to set or recover the admin account.
# OVERRIDE_ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@example.com"

# OPTIONAL: Configure API request limits to prevent abuse.
# The application provides sensible defaults if these are not set.
#
# Limit for the /auth/request-code endpoint (requests per window).
# RATE_LIMIT_REQUEST_CODE_LIMIT=3
# Window for the /auth/request-code endpoint, in hours.
# RATE_LIMIT_REQUEST_CODE_WINDOW_HOURS=24
#
# Limit for the generic /data API endpoints (requests per window).
# RATE_LIMIT_DATA_API_LIMIT=1000
# Window for the /data API endpoints, in minutes.
