/// This middleware runs *after* the `dataFetchMiddleware`, which means it can
/// safely assume that the requested item has already been fetched and is
/// available in the context.
///
/// It performs the following steps:
/// 1. Determines if an ownership check is required for the current action
///    based on the `ModelConfig`.
/// 2. If a check is required and the user is not an admin, it reads the
///    pre-fetched item from the context.
/// 3. It then compares the item's owner ID with the authenticated user's ID.
/// 4. If the IDs do not match, it throws a [ForbiddenException].
/// 5. If the check is not required or passes, it calls the next handler.
